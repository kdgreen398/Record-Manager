FOUND IN:  British Journal of Educational Technology; v27 n1 p33-44 Jan 1996
Abstract:  Describes an investigation of the search strategies employed by
 novice users of an interactive information system. A class of 12-year-old
 students was instructed in use of an electronic encyclopedia, which they used
 as an information source for projects and to complete skills tests. Students
 employed inefficient search strategies and had difficulty creating search
 requests for information-related problems. (Author/JKP)

Title:  The Effect of Anaphor and Ellipsis Resolution on Proximity Searching in
 a Text Database. / by Pirkola, Ari; Jarvelin, Kalervo
Pub.Date:  1996
Document no.:  EJ516537
FOUND IN:  Information Processing & Management; v32 n2 p199-216 Mar 1996
Abstract:  Using a newspaper article database, this study analyzed the effects
 of ellipsis and anaphor resolution on proximity searching in a full-text
 database; 154 keyword pairs in different categories were created. Findings
 indicate that some resolution method might be developed only for proper name
 phrases to support keyword-based full-text information retrieval. (Author/AEF)

Title:  An Extended Vector-Processing Scheme for Searching Information in
 Hypertext Systems. / by Savoy, Jacques
Pub.Date:  1996
Document no.:  EJ516534
FOUND IN:  Information Processing & Management; v32 n2 p155-70 Mar 1996
Abstract:  Proposes an extended vector-processing scheme that extracts
 information from hypertext links to enhance retrieval effectiveness. Evaluates
 the impact of bibliographic references, bibliographic coupling, cocitation and
 document representative relationships. Shows that hypertext links do not always
 improve average precision, and interdocument relationships do not compensate
 for an appropriate choice of other retrieval features. (Author/AEF)

FOUND IN:  Journal of Documentation; v51 n4 p388-403 Dec 1995
Abstract:  Parallels between subsistence foraging and scholarly information
 seeking are described in the context of the World Wide Web. Suggests that the
 prevailing information retrieval paradigm does not capture the complex of
 behavior and stimuli that drives scholars' quests for new ideas and insights.
 Research questions are suggested by extended use of the optimal foraging
 metaphor. (Author/JKP)

Title:  Memory Efficient Ranking. / by Moffat, Alistair; And Others
Pub.Date:  1994
Document no.:  EJ493355
FOUND IN:  Information Processing & Management; v30 n6 p733-44 Nov-Dec 1994
Abstract:  Describes an approximate document ranking process that uses a compact
 array of in-memory, low-precision approximations for document length. Combined
 with another rule for reducing the memory required by partial similarity
 accumulators, the approximation heuristic allows the ranking of large document
 collections using less than one byte of memory per document. (20 references)

Pub.Date:  1996
Document no.:  EJ516617
FOUND IN:  School Library Media Activities Monthly; v12 n6 p29-32 Feb 1996
Abstract:  Effective notetaking in student research consists of three steps:
 identification of key-word and related words in the researchable questions,
 skimming and scanning, and extracting needed information. These steps begin
 after students have defined and narrowed the task, constructed researchable
 questions, and located appropriate sources. Two sidebars provide examples.

Title:  Optimal Weight Assignment for a Chinese Signature File. / by Liang,
 Tyne; And Others
Pub.Date:  1996
Document no.:  EJ516539
FOUND IN:  Information Processing & Management; v32 n2 p227-37 Mar 1996
Abstract:  Investigates the performance of a character-based Chinese text
 retrieval scheme in which monogram keys and bigram keys are encoded into
 document signatures. Tests and verifies the theoretical predictions of the
 optimal weight assignments and the minimal false hit rate in experiments using
 a real Chinese corpus for disyllabic queries of different association values.

Title:  Search Models: Who Does the Looking? / by Duffield, Judith A.
Pub.Date:  1996
Document no.:  EJ516495
FOUND IN:  School Library Media Activities Monthly; v12 n5 p28-30 Jan 1996
Abstract:  Describes two search models for school libraries. Models include
 searches defined by the student but conducted by a trained searcher, and
 student-conducted searches which teach search skills. Decisions about which
 model (or combination) to use should be based on the available resources and
 the purposes for conducting the search. (AEF)

Pub.Date:  1995
Document no.:  EJ515155
FOUND IN:  School Library Media Activities Monthly; v12 n4 p35-37 Dec 1995
Abstract:  Discusses analytical searching, a process that enables searchers of
 electronic resources to develop a planned strategy by combining words or
 phrases with Boolean operators. Defines simple and complex searching, and
 describes search strategies developed with Boolean logic and truncation.
 Provides guidelines for teaching students analytical searching. (AEF)

Title:  Multiple Search Sessions by End-Users of Online Catalogs and CD-ROM
 Databases. / by Spink, Amanda; Beatty, Leslie
Pub.Date:  1995
Document no.:  EJ513858
FOUND IN:  Proceedings of the ASIS Annual Meeting; v32 p77-83 1995
Abstract:  Results are reported from a study that investigated the extent to
 which academic library end users conducted multiple search sessions with online
 public access catalogs or CD-ROM databases at different stages of their
 information seeking related to a research project. Implications for training,
 retrieval systems design, and further research are discussed. (Author/LRW)

Title:  The "Known" in Known-Item Searches: Empirical Support for User-Centered
 Design. / by Wildemuth, Barbara M.; O'Neill, Ann L.
Pub.Date:  1995
Document no.:  EJ510315
FOUND IN:  College & Research Libraries; v56 n3 p265-81 May 1995
Abstract:  User-centered design of catalog records requires the study of user
 behaviors and cognition related to interaction with the catalog. During 3
 phases of a pilot study, 103 catalog users described 386 searches; searchers
 generally knew the title, publication date, page numbers, and/or the author.

Title:  Is Keyword Searching the Answer? / by Tillotson, Joy
Pub.Date:  1995
Document no.:  EJ510309
FOUND IN:  College & Research Libraries; v56 n3 p199-206 May 1995
Abstract:  Examines three aspects of keyword searching as a possible solution to
 subject search problems in online public access catalogs (OPACs). Discusses
 search results, user satisfaction, and how keyword searching and controlled
 vocabulary searching are offered in OPAC interfaces. Concludes that keyword
 searching and controlled vocabulary searching should be made easily available
 with improved explanations. (Author/AEF)

Abstract:  A review of literature from 1983 to 1992 suggests that a more
 complete understanding is now possible of the information needs, uses, and
 information-seeking behavior of the humanities scholar. A current portrait of
 humanities scholars suggests that this client group is more diverse than
 previously assumed. (Author/JKP)
